## Request For Quotation (RFQ)

A request for quotation (RFQ) is a document that a company or organization sends to potential suppliers to request quotes for products or services. RFQs are often used when a company or organization is looking to purchase a large quantity of goods or services, or when they need to compare prices from multiple suppliers.
